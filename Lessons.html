       Today i learnt that instead of struggling with writing alot of things in css files, there is something that we can do to save our energy and that is Bootstraps.<br>This files indeed have a collection of a bunch of css files which will enable us style our codes easily.Bootstrap help alot of Front-End Developers to create a responsive websites.Thanks for following my dreams everyday God bless you.

       Still on Bootstrap i played arround bootstrap.css to add some styling to my html codes. What i noice was that bootstrap.css is already fixed with styling features with respect to the individual class names, so I realised that what i have to do is to make sure make class name in index.html is the same as the one in bootstrap.css other than that no effect will take place. So basically bootstrap.css is easy when I'm conversant with how i will use my individual class in the index.html. Thank you again for following my vision, I will surely get there Isha Allah.
